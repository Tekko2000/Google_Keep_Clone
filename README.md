Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

thanks for stopping by to my Github profile.

This is a Google Keep clone that I made during the Frontend Career Path course @ www.scrimba.com.

It includes of course HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript.

We used the class constructor for this project for practicing purpose.

I hope you will enjoy it.
